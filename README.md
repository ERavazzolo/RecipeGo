## Description
RecipeGo is an index webapp, which allows to save the name and the page number of a physical recipe book. 
It is then possible to search for a particular recipe and RecipeGo will return the page number.

The idea came to solve an apparently simple problem: for years I have been updating a recipe book by constantly adding new pages of recipes. Because it is handwritten, the recipe cannot be in alphabetical order without compromising the ability to add new ones in. I would often find myself turning pages back and forth to find just the one I needed. So, I numbered all the pages of my book and created RecipeGo as an index.

## Goals
- Specify RecipeGo main functions
- Determine what the user is able to do on RecipeGo
- Build the index app using Javascript and implement its functions
- Use LocalStorage to make the app functional
- Create basic design for the webapp and implement it
- Test design for responsibility at different screen widths

## Tech Stack 
- Sass
- Css Grid Layout
- Javascript - ES5
- NPM

## Outcome
I am very proud of this project as I did hit a few rocks on my road through learning Javascript.
At first I found the language quite boring, although I could see its charm in terms of what can be accomplished. Then, I discovered once again my love for problem solving and I would not give up until everything worked to my liking.

While some things can be improved in terms of design and UX, I decided to solely prioritize my understanding of how Javascript works, its concepts and its rules , rather than focusing on the design and other features.
